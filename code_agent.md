**Key Architecture Components (Refined):**

1.  **Enhanced Automated Test Generation:**
    *   LLM-generated pytest tests are now more focused on Jina API interactions, input validation, response handling, and error conditions.
    *   The prompt emphasizes comprehensive tests and realistic test scenarios.
    *   Tests now explicitly require `JINA_API_KEY` to be set, making them runnable out-of-the-box with proper environment setup.

2.  **Improved Iterative Development Loop:**
    *   Increased default retry attempts to allow for more iterations in complex tasks.
    *   More robust error handling within the loop, catching `CodeValidationError` and general exceptions.
    *   Detailed version history now includes test output for failed versions, aiding in debugging and analysis.
    *   Clearer user feedback during iterations, indicating progress and failures.

3.  **Safer Code Handling:**
    *   Continued safety validation against dangerous code patterns in both generated code and tests.
    *   Use of `Pathlib` for safer and more robust file operations.
    *   Improved error handling for file operations, subprocess execution, and JSON parsing.

4.  **More Intelligent Feedback Integration:**
    *   The feedback prompt to the LLM is refined to provide more context and instructions for code revision, including focusing on specific test failures and maintaining code quality.
    *   Feedback to the LLM now includes formatted test case names and error messages for better readability and understanding by the language model.

**Implementation Tips (Expanded):**

1.  **Robust Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement comprehensive `try-except` blocks throughout the code, especially for file I/O, subprocess calls, API interactions, and JSON parsing.
    *   Use Python's `logging` module for more structured logging to files or external services for in-depth debugging and monitoring of the automated process.

2.  **Advanced Test Fixtures and Mocking:**
    *   For more complex Jina API interactions, utilize pytest fixtures to set up test environments and mock API responses. This allows for isolated testing of code logic without actual API calls, improving test speed and reliability, and avoiding rate limits during testing.

3.  **Code Quality and Style Enforcement:**
    *   Integrate code linters (like `flake8`) and formatters (like `black`) into the automated pipeline to ensure consistent code style and catch potential code quality issues early in the development cycle. Consider adding a validation step after code generation to enforce these standards.

4.  **Security Sandboxing:**
    *   For enhanced security, especially when dealing with potentially untrusted generated code, consider running tests in isolated containers (e.g., using Docker). This sandboxes the test execution environment and prevents potential harm to the host system.

5.  **Performance Monitoring and Optimization:**
    *   Monitor the execution time of each iteration, especially test runs and code generation steps. Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code or test configurations accordingly. Consider implementing caching mechanisms where applicable to speed up repetitive tasks.

Remember to set your `JINA_API_KEY` environment variable before running the generated code and tests.
