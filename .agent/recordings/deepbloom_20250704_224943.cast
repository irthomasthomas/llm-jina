Something to be proud.\r\nThink through all of the steps required and make a bold plan.\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to ensure that all the capabilities described in jina-metaprompt.md are implemented here, using the all the latest models. \r\nThen you must build or update a complete test suite. You must then execute the tests and iterate on the project code until it passes.\r\nYou must not cheat on the tests, or write place-holder code, ever.\r\n\r\nCreate a document with the plan.
