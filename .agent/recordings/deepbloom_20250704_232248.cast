According to the `llm` plugin documentation, `llm` will look for a file named `llm_jina/__init__.py` and execute a `register_models(register)` function within it to make the plugin's models available.\r\n\r\nThe problem is likely within that registration process or in the model implementation itself. The plugin must correctly subclass `llm.Model` and call `response.log()` to ensure the prompt and response are logged.\r\n\r\nMy next step is to examine the `llm_jina/__init__.py` file to see how the models are registered.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\ncat ./src/llm_jina/__init__.py\r\n"]
[81.77962, "o", "Response:\r\nOkay, this `__init__.py` file is revealing. It seems to be using `llm.hookimpl` for command registration and another custom hook for embedding models. I don't see a `register_models` hook which is used for chat models. This suggests the plugin might only be implementing embedding models and not generative chat models, which would explain why no prompts are being logged. Embedding operations often aren't logged in the same way as prompt/response cycles.\r\n\r\nHowever, the file tree shows a `code_agent` directory and other modules like `search`, which imply more than just embeddings.\r\n\r\nThe `register_commands` hook adds the `jina` subcommand using `jina_cli` from `llm_jina.commands`. This is my next point of investigation. I'll check `llm_jina/commands.py` to see what functions are being exposed to the command line and how they are implemented. This should clarify the plugin's actual capabilities.\r\n\r\n<CODE>\r\ncat ./src/llm_jina/commands.py\r\n"]
[89.890408, "o", "Response:\r\nThis is the key. The `commands.py` file defines several commands, but they are all custom Click commands. They are not `llm` models.\r\n\r\nThe `generate_code` function, for example, is a complex workflow that calls an LLM internally:\r\n`refine_generator = CodeGenerator(prompt=feedback_prompt, model_id=model)`\r\n`current_code = refine_generator.generate()`\r\n\r\nThis `CodeGenerator` class is where the `llm` tool is likely being called. However, since this is a custom command (`llm jina generate-code ...`) and not a standard model invocation (`llm -m jina-something ...`), it bypasses the `llm` tool's built-in logging mechanism. The plugin is essentially using `llm` as a library from within a Click command, rather than registering a model for `llm` to call directly.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the `CodeGenerator` class needs to be modified to manually log its prompts and responses to the `llm` database.\r\n\r\nFirst, I need to find the `CodeGenerator` class and its `generate` method. Based on the `imports`, it's located in `src/llm_jina/code_agent/generator.py`.\r\n\r\nI will now inspect that file.\r\n<CODE>\r\ncat src/llm_jina/code_agent/generator.py\r\n"]
[96.914613, "o", "Response:\r\nOkay, this confirms my suspicion. The `generate` method in `CodeGenerator` calls the LLM using `self.model.prompt(self.prompt)`. This is a direct call to the model object, which returns a `Response` object.\r\n\r\nCrucially, the code then extracts the text using `response.text()` but **never** calls `response.log()`. This is the missing piece. The `llm` tool will not log a prompt/response pair unless `response.log()` is explicitly called on the `Response` object.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I need to add `response.log()` to the `generate` method.\r\n\r\nHere's the plan:\r\n1.

Logging is handled by the `llm` library **after** the `model.prompt()` call returns, but only when the `Response` object is used in a specific way. The framework handles the logging automatically *if the plugin is a registered model*.\r\n3.  When using `llm` as a library (as this plugin does), logging is NOT automatic.\r\n4.  The documentation shows that you can log additional JSON data to the database using `response.response_json = {\"key\": \"value\"}`. It *implies* that the core prompt/response logging is handled separately, but does not state how to trigger it manually from a library call.\r\n5.  A more promising lead is in `advanced-model-plugins.md`: `response.set_usage(input_tokens, output_tokens)` is mentioned for logging token usage. This suggests that the `Response` object is indeed the place to add information, but `log()` is not the method.\r\n\r\nThe most critical section is in `plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.md`:\r\n> The prompt and the response will be logged to a SQLite database automatically by LLM.\r\n\r\nThis automatic logging only happens for registered models that are executed through the standard `llm -m my-model 'prompt'` flow. The `llm-jina` plugin is bypassing this by implementing its own Click commands and calling `model.prompt()` internally.\r\n\r\nThe documentation doesn't provide an explicit function like `llm.log_prompt(prompt, response)`. This means there is no simple, direct way to add a log entry from within this custom command structure.\r\n\r\nThere are two potential paths forward:\r\n"]
[148.354426, "o", "A. **Re-architect the plugin**: Change the `generate-code` command to be a registered `llm` model.

This is more of a hack, but it will solve the immediate problem without re-architecting the plugin. `llm` uses `sqlite-utils`, so the database interaction should be straightforward.
