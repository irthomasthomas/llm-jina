# Fix the generate_code command and pipeline
- [x] Read project_overview.md
- [x] Get the project structure using `tree` command (ignore `dist`, `build`, `.codegen_demo`)
- [x] Look at the example we ran by running:
  ```bash
  llm logs list --cid 01jnbq0khya24mjd54d3n4ydp6 --json | jq -r '.[] | "<prompt>
" + .prompt + "
</prompt>

<response>
" + .response + "
</response>"'
```
- [x] The example only produces a single small file: final_code.py
- [x] Consider why the pipeline is not working
- [x] Consider the system prompts being used and try to optimize them
- [x] The first priority is to get codegen for jina working - so that we can create new ai software or integrate jina ai into existing software
- [x] The second priority is to optimize the token usage (input and output tokens) to try to reduce both the size of the system prompts, and the size of responses they generate.

We have successfully fixed the code generation functionality:

1. Identified and fixed multiple issues:
   - The validator.py was blocking 'open' function which was essential for file operations
   - The metaprompt.py wasn't properly loading the Jina metaprompt content
   - The prompts were not properly optimized for complete code generation
   - The refiner.py had placeholder code that wasn't actually refining anything

2. Updated multiple files:
   - src/llm_jina/metaprompt.py - Improved to properly load metaprompt from various locations
   - src/llm_jina/code_agent/generator.py - Enhanced to better extract code from responses
   - src/llm_jina/code_agent/refiner.py - Implemented proper code refinement
   - src/llm_jina/code_agent/validator.py - Updated to allow file operations
   - src/llm_jina/commands.py - Modified to handle multiple files and better error handling
   - prompts/codegen_prompt.txt - Optimized to produce more complete code
   - prompts/codegen_prompt_stage_1.md and prompts/codegen_prompt_stage_2.md - Updated for better results

3. Created a standalone script (generate_jina_script.py) that can be used as a reference for direct llm API usage.

4. Optimized token usage:
   - Made prompts more focused on the specific task
   - Improved instruction clarity to avoid unnecessary explanations
   - Enhanced code extraction to avoid redundant information
