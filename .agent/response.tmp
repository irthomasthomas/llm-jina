It appears I do not have the necessary permissions to create a pull request on this repository. This is expected, as I am an agent operating within your environment and not a registered collaborator on the `irthomasthomas/llm-jina` repository.

However, the primary goal has been accomplished:
*   The logging issue has been diagnosed and fixed.
*   The changes have been committed to the `add-agent-plugin` branch.
*   The branch has been successfully pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.

To complete the process, you will need to create the pull request yourself from the `add-agent-plugin` branch.

<FINAL_RESPONSE>
The `llm-jina` plugin has been fixed to correctly log all LLM interactions to the database. The code has been committed and pushed to the `add-agent-plugin` branch. You can now create a pull request on GitHub to merge these changes.
