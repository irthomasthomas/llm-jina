Unfortunately, the provided HTML content is a 404 error page, not a documentation page. Therefore, I cannot extract the steps for creating a new embedding model plugin for the LLM command-line tool from this content.

To get the information you need, you would have to visit the correct documentation URL.

However, based on common patterns for creating plugins for command-line tools, particularly those built with Click or similar frameworks, I can provide a **hypothetical outline of the likely key steps**:

**Hypothetical Key Steps for Creating an LLM Embedding Model Plugin:**

1.  **Understand the Plugin Interface:**
    *   **Base Class for Embedding Models:** There will likely be a specific Python abstract base class (e.g., `llm.plugins.EmbeddingModel` or similar) that your custom embedding model must inherit from.
    *   **Required Methods:** This base class will define abstract methods that your plugin must implement. These are almost certainly going to include:
        *   `__init__(self, key, model_id, etc.)`: For initializing your model with necessary parameters (e.g., API key, model identifier).
        *   `embed(self, text: str) -> list[float]`: The core method that takes a string of text and returns a list of floats (the embedding vector).
        *   Possibly `batch_embed(self, texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]`: For optimizing performance by embedding multiple texts at once.
        *   `cost_per_token`: (Optional, but good practice) To indicate the cost of using the model.
        *   `max_tokens`: (Optional) To indicate the maximum input token length.
        *   `model_name`: (Optional) A display name for the model.
        *   `supports_text_embedding`: A boolean indicating if the model supports text embedding (as opposed to, say, image embedding).

2.  **Create Your Python Module/Package:**
    *   Organize your code within a Python package (e.g., `llm_myembedding_plugin/`).
    *   Define your custom embedding model class within this package, inheriting from the LLM base class.

    ```python
    # llm_myembedding_plugin/model.py
    import llm

    # Assuming llm.EmbeddingModel is the base class
    # You'll need to confirm the actual import path and class name from the docs.
    class MyCustomEmbeddingModel(llm.plugins.EmbeddingModel):
        model_id = "my-custom-embedding-model" # A unique ID for your model
        batch_size = 100 # Example, for batching

        def __init__(self, key: str = None, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(self.model_id, f"My Custom Model ({self.model_id}) for LLM CLI")
            self.api_key = key
            # Initialize your specific API client or ML model here
            print(f"MyCustomEmbeddingModel initialized with key: {self.api_key}")

        def embed(self, text: str) -> list[float]:
            # This is where you'd make an API call or run your local model
            # to get the embedding for 'text'
            print(f"Embedding text: {text[:50]}...")
            # Simulate an embedding
            embedding = [float(ord(c) % 100) / 100.0 for c in text[:100]] + [0.0] * (1536 - len(text[:100]))
            return embedding[:1536] # Ensure correct embedding dimension

        # You might also implement batch_embed for efficiency
        # def batch_embed(self, texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
        #     # ... make batched API calls ...
        #     return [self.embed(text) for text in texts] # Simple example, optimize this

        @property
        def supports_text_embedding(self) -> bool:
            return True

        # Add other properties/methods as required by the abstract base class
    ```

3.  **Define Plugin Entry Points in `pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py`):**
    *   This is crucial for `llm` to discover your plugin. You'll typically use the `[project.entry-points]` table (for `pyproject.toml` and PEP 621) or `entry_points` in `setup.py`.
    *   The entry point group will likely be specific to `llm` and its plugin system, e.g., `llm.embedding_models`.
    *   The value will be a key (how your model is referenced) mapping to a Python path pointing to your model class.

    ```toml
    # pyproject.toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
    build-backend = "setuptools.build_backend"

    [project]
    name = "llm-my-embedding-plugin"
    version = "0.1.0"
    authors = [
        {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"},
    ]
    description = "A custom LLM embedding plugin for my model"
    readme = "README.md"
    requires-python = ">=3.8"
    license = {text = "MIT License"}
    dependencies = [
        "llm", # Specify the version compatability if needed
        # Add any specific libraries your embedding model needs (e.g., requests, your_ml_framework)
    ]

    [project.entry-points."llm.embedding_models"]
    my-custom-model = "llm_myembedding_plugin.model:MyCustomEmbeddingModel"
    ```
    *   **Explanation of `llm.embedding_models`**: This is the critical part. It tells `llm` that "my-custom-model" is an embedding model and can be found by importing `MyCustomEmbeddingModel` from `llm_myembedding_plugin.model`.

4.  **Installation and Usage:**
    *   Users will install your plugin using pip: `pip install llm-my-embedding-plugin`.
    *   Once installed, `llm` should automatically discover your model.
    *   Usage would then likely be: `llm embed -m my-custom-model "Hello, world!"`
    *   If your model requires an API key, there would probably be a mechanism to pass it, e.g., via environment variables (`LLM_MY_CUSTOM_MODEL_KEY=...`) or `llm keys set my-custom-model <your-key>`.

**To get the precise, correct information, you need to consult the official `llm` documentation, specifically the section on creating plugins or extending `llm`.** I recommend checking the project's GitHub repository or searching for "LLM command-line tool plugins" or "LLM embedding model extension".
